		Starting off with a summer's dream, we're going to <i>Le Havre</i>, a small city in the Normandy region of northern France. As Lonely Planet says, Le Havre, <q>Will celebrate its 500th anniversary with a five-month-long, art- and music-filled fete,</q> this summer. There’s plenty to see in this historically-rich commune, with the unique blend of old and new architecture serving as a particular point of interest for Heather Cowper, as she explains in her weekend guide to Le Havre. <q>What Le Havre lost in its picturesque pre-war town, it has more than made up for in stunning modern architecture like Le Volcan, the Volcano shaped cultural centre by Brazilian architect, Oscar Niemeyer. We walked down the steps from the road to an open piazza below the level of the main town and through the library which was packed with families, teenagers and locals of all ages.</q> Sitting on the English Channel, Le Havre is close to both Paris and London, making it an easy weekend getaway destination.

		As The Telegraph explains, <q>Cyprus is a land for romantics, dotted with castles, churches, monasteries, mosaics, white-sand beaches and the bluest of seas. Early suitors include Marc Antony, who thought the island so fragrant he gave it to Cleopatra, and Richard the Lionheart, who briefly put down his crossbow to marry there.</q> Beware of when you go, though, as Cyprus can get devastatingly hot: <q>You can bet neither of these alpha males had the energy for anything in August, when the heat is so paralysing you could be on Mars.</q> With that said, 300 days of sunshine per year and January temperatures in the mid-sixties makes a pretty strong case for a winter vacation in Cyprus.

		Moldova is another seldom-visited European nation, probably because few know what it has to offer. A landscape of low, rolling hills and a secretive cave monasteries are just a few of the gems you’ll discover here. Moldova’s capital city, Chişinău, is wonderfully slow, but the countryside is where you’ll feel most at peace. Take a trip to Orhei, an hour’s drive north of Chişinău, for a hike through fields and forests and a glimpse at the sacred Orheiul Vechi. Vino lover's rejoice: wine is one of Moldova's primary exports, so there’s no surprise that the country will play host to the 2017’s Black Sea Wines and Spirits Competition, plus its annual ExpoVin.

		Hamburg's Elbphilharmonie, one of the most acoustically-advanced concert halls in the world, opened this January to the locals' delight. With or without the new facility, Hamburg is a charming city that has captured the hearts of many. Mitzie Mee chose to explore a different side of the city in her look at Speicherstadt, the largest warehouse area in the world and a recently-named UNESCO World Heritage Site. <q>It was such a beautiful place to walk around in during daytime, so one evening I decided to walk from the Rathaus Station and back to the hotel through Speicherstadt, as I wanted to see what the area was like after dark. It was very dark and it was very quiet. Even though I never felt unsafe in the sense that I was afraid to get assaulted or robbed, the place still managed to scare the guts out of me. The spookiness all came from the dim lighting and the completely deserted streets. I wouldn't have been surprised to see Dracula, a zombie army or Ozzy Osbourne around the next corner.</q>
